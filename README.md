This mod was made as part of an archival project in the Rain World discord server. Thanks to Henpemaz for figuring out how to restore the game's source code using
version 1.0's files.

As of April 26th, 2025, this mod has been moved over to https://codeberg.org/HelloThere/BetaEchoes
The GitHub version will stay public as an archive, but development will continue on Codeberg from now on.
